I am a Ph.D. student at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden.
My doctoral studies began in September 2018 at the [Robotics, Perception and Learning division](https://www.kth.se/rpl/division-of-robotics-perception-and-learning-1.779439), under the supervision of Prof. Hossein Azizpour.\
Beforehand, I studied a [master's in Machine Learning](https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/machinelearning/description-1.48533) at KTH, during which I interned at a [foodtech startup](https://dahmakan.com/kuala-lumpur/about) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and joined the [Zalando Research](https://research.zalando.com/) team for my thesis in Berlin, Germany.

My research is focused on the **explainability of deep learning**, which in simple words encompasses everything related to improving our understanding of modern learning systems, from their internal representations to the way they determine a prediction.

The long-term ambition is to be able to approach AI agents _as peers_, to whom we'd be able to ask questions and observe the reasoning process. This, in turn, would allow developers to easily **debug issues and biases**, and the general public to **trust AI** more in their everyday life.

As part of my teaching duties, I happily served as a **teacher assistant** for the following courses:
- [Artificial Intelligence (DD2380)](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DD2380?l=en)
- [Deep Learning (DD2424)](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DD2424?l=en)
- [Deep Learning Advanced (DD2412)](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DD2412?l=en)

Teaching is cool, but the command line is cooler. So, I also volunteered as **sysadmin** of our in-house GPU cluster. Together with two other Ph.D. students, I helped procure and currently maintain a SLURM cluster of 50+ GPUs for the benefit of all other students' research.
